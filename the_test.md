# Programming Test Setup Guide

## Stack Overview

This is a **full-stack monorepo** with the following technologies:

### Frontend

- **Nodejs 22** - Runtime (check .nvmrc)
- **Nuxt 4** - Vue.js framework with SSR/SSG
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe JavaScript
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework
- **VueUse** - Vue composition utilities
- **nuxt-swiper** - Swiper.js integration for sliders

### Backend

- **Strapi 5** - Headless CMS with GraphQL
- **SQLite** - Database (development)
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe backend
- **Auto-generated types** - From Strapi schema

### Key Features

- **Monorepo structure** - Frontend and backend in one repository
- **Type generation** - Automatic TypeScript types from Strapi
- **GraphQL API** - Modern data fetching
- **Responsive design** - Mobile-first approach
- **SEO optimized** - Server-side rendering

## Getting Started

### 1. Extract and Setup

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Environment Configuration

The `.env` files are included in the zip, they are already configured. Key environment variables:

**Backend (.env):**

- `DATABASE_CLIENT=sqlite`
- `DATABASE_FILENAME=.tmp/data.db`
- `JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret`
- `ADMIN_JWT_SECRET=your-admin-jwt-secret`

**Frontend (.env):**

- `NUXT_PUBLIC_STRAPI_URL=http://localhost:1337`
- `SITE_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000`

### 3. Start Development Servers

```bash
npm run dev
```

- Strapi will start on `http://localhost:1337`
- Admin panel: `http://localhost:1337/admin` username: `admin@admin.com` password: `Admin123`
- Nuxt will start on `http://localhost:3000`

### 4. Generate Types

Types are already generated to get started, but if you change the backend run the regeneration.

```bash
npm run generate-types
```

```

## Development Workflow

1. **Content Management**: Use Strapi admin panel to create content
2. **Frontend Development**: Build components in `frontend/app/components/`
3. **Type Safety**: Run `npm run generate-types` after schema changes
4. **Testing**: Both servers should run simultaneously

## Key Commands

```bash
# Backend
npm run dev              # Start Strapi
npm run generate-types   # Generate TypeScript types
npm run build           # Build for production

# Frontend
npm run dev             # Start Nuxt
npm run build          # Build for production
npm run generate       # Generate static site
```

## Ready for Tasks

Once both servers are running and you can access:

- Frontend: `http://localhost:3000`
- Backend: `http://localhost:1337/admin`

You have 4 hours to complete as many tasks as possible. Keep in mind that this tasklist would be enough for more than 1 day of work, so try to prioritize and focus on the most important tasks that can be done within the time.

Please note where you finished within the time and what you would have done if you had more time.
